The intent is to avoid the network and storage bandwidth needed to handle the image until it's reasonably certain that it will be needed. This generally improves the performance of the content in most typical use cases.While explicit width and height attributes are recommended for all images to avoid layout shift, they are especially important for lazy-loaded ones. Lazy-loaded images will never be loaded if they do not intersect a visible part of an element, even if loading them would change that, because unloaded images have a width and height of 0. It creates an even more disruptive user experience when the content visible in the viewport reflows in the middle of reading it.The load event is fired after eager-loaded images have been fetched and processed, but before lazy-laded ones are, even if the lazy-loaded images are located within the visual viewport immediately upon initial page load. These images are still loaded as soon as layout completes; they just don't affect the timing of the load event.

This is an anti-tracking measure, because if a user agent supported lazy loading when scripting is disabled, it would still be possible for a site to track a user's approximate scroll position throughout a session, by strategically placing images in a page's markup such that a server can track how many images are requested and when.",

The spec requires that the sizes attribute to only be present when srcset uses width descriptors.A source size consists of:A media condition, omitted for the last item in the list.A source size value.Media conditions describe properties of the viewport, not the image. For example, (height <= 500px) 1000px proposes using an image source of 1000px width if the viewport height is 500px or less. Because a source size descriptor specifies the width to use for the image during layout, the media condition is typically (but not necessarily) based on the width.Source size values specify the intended display size of the image. User agents use the current source size to select one of the sources supplied by the srcset attribute, when those sources are described using width (w) descriptors. The selected source size affects the intrinsic size of the image (the image's display size if no CSS styling is applied).A source size value can be any non-negative length. It must not use CSS functions other than the math functions. Units are interpreted in the same way as media queries, meaning that all relative length units are relative to the document root rather than the <img> element. For example, an em value is relative to the root font size, not the font size of the image. Percentage values are not allowed. If the sizes attribute is not provided, it has a default value of 100vw (the viewport width).The auto keyword can replace the whole list of sizes or the first entry in the list. It is only valid when combined with loading=\"lazy\", and resolves to the concrete size of the image. Since the intrinsic size of the image is not yet known, width and height attributes (or CSS equivalents) should also be specified to prevent the browser from assuming the default image width of 300px.For better backward compatibility with browsers that do not support auto, you can include fallback sizes after auto in the sizes attribute:html<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 30em) 100vw, (max-width: 50em) 50vw, calc(33vw - 100px)\" srcset=\" swing-200.jpg 200w, swing-400.jpg 400w, swing-800.jpg 800w, swing-1600.jpg 1600w \" src=\"swing-400.jpg\" alt=\"Kettlebell Swing\" />",

It must match the intrinsic width of the referenced image. The width descriptor is divided by the source size given in the sizes attribute to calculate the effective pixel density. For example, to provide an image resource to be used when the renderer needs a 450 pixel wide image, use the width descriptor 450w. When a srcset contains \"w\" descriptors, the browser uses those descriptors together with the sizes attribute to pick a resource.A pixel density descriptor (a positive floating point number directly followed by x). It specifies the condition in which the corresponding image resource should be used as the display's pixel density. For example, to provide an image resource to be used when the pixel density is double the standard density, use the pixel density descriptor 2x or 2.0x.If no descriptor is specified, the source is assigned the default descriptor of 1x. It is incorrect to mix width descriptors and pixel density descriptors in the same srcset attribute. Duplicate descriptors (for instance, two sources in the same srcset which are both described with 2x) are also invalid.Space characters, other than the whitespace separating the URL and the corresponding condition descriptor, are ignored; this includes both leading and trailing space, as well as space before or after each comma. However, if an image candidate string contains no descriptors and no whitespace after the URL, the following image candidate string, if there is one, must begin with one or more whitespace, or the comma will be considered part of the URL.When the <img> element's srcset uses x descriptors, browsers also consider the URL in the src attribute (if present) as a candidate, and assign it a default descriptor of 1x. On the other hand, if the srcset attribute uses width descriptors, src is not considered, and the sizes attribute is used instead.The user agent selects any of the available sources at its discretion.

Such content should be also served from a separate origin to limit potential damage.Note:When redirecting the user, opening a popup window, or opening a new tab from an embedded page within an <iframe> with the sandbox attribute, the new browsing context is subject to the same sandbox restrictions.
